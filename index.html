      <!--- About --->
      <h2></h2>

      <p>The problem that mental health awareness addresses is the pervasive lack of attention, understanding, and
        support
        for mental health issues in society. It is a problem because, for far too long, mental health concerns have been
        stigmatized, ignored, or downplayed, resulting in numerous negative consequences for individuals and society as
        a
        whole.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> One significant problem related to mental health awareness is the stigma associated with mental illness.
        Stigma
        refers to the negative attitudes, stereotypes, and discrimination that people with mental health conditions
        often
        face. This issue is problematic for several reasons.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p> Firstly, stigma creates barriers to seeking help. People with mental health conditions may fear being judged
        or
        labeled if they admit to their struggles, causing them to delay or avoid seeking treatment. Consequently, their
        mental health problems may worsen before they receive support.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>Secondly, stigma leads to isolation and shame. Individuals affected by stigma may hide their mental health
        challenges, which can exacerbate their symptoms and hinder their recovery. This isolation can have profound
        negative effects on their overall well-being. </p>
      <br><br>

      <p>These reasons are why I believe my website is a much needed resource that people can benefit from. </p>
