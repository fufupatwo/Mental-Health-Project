## Project Overview

I initiated this project with the primary goal of deepening my grasp of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Serving as an excellent mini project, it has provided me with a solid foundation to confidently embark on learning React. Now equipped with fundamental skills, I am ready to take on React and further enhance my web development capabilities.
